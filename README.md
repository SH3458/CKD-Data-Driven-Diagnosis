# CKD-Data-Driven-Diagnosis

## Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible decline in kidney function, affecting millions of people globally. It can result from various underlying conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension. As CKD advances, the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and fluids from the body, leading to the accumulation of harmful substances. If left untreated, this can result in kidney failure, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.

CKD is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, infections, and premature death. Managing CKD involves controlling underlying conditions and making lifestyle changes to slow the progression of the disease.
